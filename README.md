# 🍀 Git Lucky

Ever wanted to approve pull requests like you're swiping on Tinder?  
**Git Lucky** is a GitHub App that turns PR voting into a game of left or right swipes.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Shows you a random PR from any participating repo.
- Swipe **right** to approve, **left** to reject.
- If the majority votes to approve, the PR gets merged.

It's anonymous. It's chaotic. It's GitHub... gamified.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Install the GitHub App on your repo.
2. PRs submitted to the repo will show up in the Git Lucky queue.
3. Users vote via a swipe-style interface.
4. Once enough votes are cast, the app auto-merges or closes the PR based on the majority.

## 🧪 Try It Out

We have a playground repo just for fun:

The app is already set up on this repo. Go wild!

## 🛠 Setup

1. [Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gitluckyapp)
2. That’s it. Seriously.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a joke project built for a hackathon. Don’t use it on production unless you’re feeling *really* lucky.
